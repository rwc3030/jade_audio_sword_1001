## User Story
- As a user, I want to have multiple clipping modes (Modern, Classic, Hard) so that I can choose the best sound for my audio processing needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The plugin must support three distinct clipping modes: Modern, Classic, and Hard.
2. Each mode should have unique sound characteristics that can be easily distinguished by users.
3. Users should be able to switch between modes seamlessly without any noticeable latency.
4. The selected mode should be visually indicated in the user interface.

## Issues to Address
1. The code does not handle cases where the user selects a clipping mode that is not available.
2. There is no validation for the input parameters when setting the clipping mode.
3. The UI does not provide feedback when switching modes, which could lead to confusion.
