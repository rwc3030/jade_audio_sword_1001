# Design Functional Vision for Jade Audio Sword

## Overview
Jade Audio Sword by NickyP stands as a revolutionary advanced audio processor that seamlessly integrates sophisticated processing capabilities with an elegantly designed user interface, offering a comprehensive solution for mastering, mixing, and production needs while maintaining a modern and professional aesthetic that promotes focus and efficiency.

## Visual Style
The interface features a thoughtfully crafted dark, matte background design that reduces visual distractions and enhances workflow productivity. The color palette predominantly showcases black and dark gray base tones, accented with carefully chosen highlights in blue, yellow, and white that effectively draw attention to critical controls and readings throughout the interface. Typography is minimal yet highly legible, primarily rendered in white for optimal contrast against the dark background, with tooltips and meters utilizing a more subtle, smaller font for secondary information.

## UI Layout
- **Top Control Bar**: 
  - Rectangular Bypass button with rounded edges and white text positioned on the far left for quick toggling of the plugin's processing.
  - A/B Toggle system near the top-right consisting of circular, minimalist buttons that illuminate when active to facilitate easy comparison between different configurations.
  - Gear icon for accessing additional customization options.

- **Left Side**: 
  - **Box Tone Section**: Offers three distinct options:
    - Modern (jade-toned box for high-frequency contour and low-pass filtering)
    - Classic (darker appearance for gentler high-frequency adjustment)
    - Flat (unaltered signal processing)
  - Positioned above the **Clipper Section** which provides three sophisticated modes (Modern, Classic, Hard) each featuring unique clipping profiles and subtle gradient styling with faint outlines.

- **Center**: 
  - Dominated by an intuitive waveform display showing real-time signal visualization including clipped portions and loudness saturation against a black background with light gray grid lines for precise decibel level monitoring.
  - Blue line representing the adjustable clipping threshold (ceiling) modified via an adjacent slider.
  - Two primary control knobs:
    - Jade knob highlighted with yellow border and ring for processing level control (displaying values like 2.03 dB).
    - ShapeSmooth knob with blue border and ring (showing values such as 1.38 dB).

- **Right Side**: 
  - Vertical peak meter displaying current dB levels in blue for safe levels and red for excessive levels.
  - Wet/Dry fader enabling parallel processing mode for subtle mixing adjustments without overwhelming the original signal.

- **Bottom Bar**: 
  - Contains essential information including Max Clip Level indicators showing the highest clip level in dB, a Clip Clock displaying specific times of peak clipping for precise troubleshooting, and detailed Input & Output LUFS measurements for monitoring loudness levels of both input and processed signals.
  - Prominent Jade and ShapeSmooth readouts in yellow and blue respectively display numerical dB values alongside a dedicated Safety button for Jade that maintains perceived loudness consistency while reducing peaks.

## Core Features and Functionality
The plugin offers extensive technical capabilities including:
- Support for multiple Clipper modes (Modern, Classic, Hard).
