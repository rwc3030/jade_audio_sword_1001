# Next Feature Details

## Milestone
- Milestone Name: Version 1.0 Release

## Epic
- Epic Name: Audio Processing Enhancements

## Feature
- Feature Name: Advanced Clipping Modes

## User Story
- As a user, I want to have multiple clipping modes (Modern, Classic, Hard) so that I can choose the best sound for my audio processing needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The plugin must support three distinct clipping modes: Modern, Classic, and Hard.
2. Each mode should have unique sound characteristics that can be easily distinguished by users.
3. Users should be able to switch between modes seamlessly without any noticeable latency.
4. The selected mode should be visually indicated in the user interface.

## Issues to Address
1. The code does not handle cases where the user selects a clipping mode that is not available.
2. There is no validation for the input parameters when setting the clipping mode.
3. The UI does not provide feedback when switching modes, which could lead to confusion.
4. The current implementation does not account for potential memory leaks when switching modes.
5. Edge cases where the user rapidly switches modes may cause unexpected behavior in the UI.
6. Logical flow issues in the mode switching function may lead to inconsistent behavior.
7. Lack of unit tests for edge cases related to clipping mode transitions.
8. Review of generated code revealed potential logical flow issues that need to be addressed.
9. Additional edge cases identified during review that require handling.
10. Step 3.5: Review the generated code for logical flow, edge cases, and functional integrity. Record any issues in 'next_feature.txt' under 'Issues to Address' and do not mark the feature as complete.

## Status
- All issues have been identified and recorded. The feature is now marked as in progress.
