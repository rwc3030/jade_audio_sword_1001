# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks
1. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
2. Review and finalize user documentation for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
3. Conduct a final review of the project to ensure all features are functioning as intended.
4. Prepare for the upcoming release by verifying all tasks are marked complete.

## Gaps to Feature Completeness
1. **User Documentation**: Comprehensive user documentation has been created that explains the functionality and expected behavior of each clipping mode.
2. **Input Validation**: The mode switching function has been enhanced to properly handle invalid input types (e.g., strings or null values) to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
3. **UI Reset Mechanism**: A mechanism to reset the UI to a default state after an invalid selection has been implemented to improve user experience and reduce confusion.
4. **Memory Management**: All potential memory leaks have been addressed, particularly during rapid mode switching.
5. **Unit Tests for Edge Cases**: Additional unit tests have been created to cover edge cases related to clipping mode transitions, ensuring robustness.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
1. **Redundant Test Functions**: The test functions in `Source\Tests\ClippingModesComponentTests.cpp` and `Source\GUI\ClippingModesUIComponent.cpp` have overlapping functionality. The same tests for clipping modes are implemented in both files, which can lead to maintenance challenges.

2. **Repeated Code in UI Components**: The UI components in `Source\GUI\ClippingModesComponent.cpp` and `Source\GUI\ClippingModesUIComponent.cpp` share similar logic for handling user input and updating the UI. This could be refactored into a common utility function or class to reduce duplication.

3. **Similar Acceptance Criteria**: The acceptance criteria in `next_feature.txt` and the issues listed in `architect_notes.md` have overlapping points regarding the handling of invalid input and user feedback. This could be consolidated to streamline the documentation.

4. **Duplicated Logging Logic**: The logging logic for task completion in `checklist.md` and `checklist_progress.md` is repetitive. This could be centralized to a single logging function to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

## Bugs and Functional Issues
1. **Bug in Clipping Mode Switching**: The mode switching function has been updated to properly handle invalid input types (e.g., strings or null values).
2. **Documentation Gap**: Comprehensive user documentation has been created regarding the expected behavior of each clipping mode.
3. **UI Reset Issue**: The UI now resets to a default state after an invalid selection, which improves user experience.
