# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks
1. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
2. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
3. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
4. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.

## Gaps to Feature Completeness
1. **User Documentation**: There is a need for comprehensive user documentation that explains the functionality and expected behavior of each clipping mode.
2. **Input Validation**: The mode switching function must be enhanced to properly handle invalid input types (e.g., strings or null values) to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
3. **UI Reset Mechanism**: Implement a mechanism to reset the UI to a default state after an invalid selection to improve user experience and reduce confusion.
4. **Memory Management**: Ensure that all potential memory leaks are addressed, particularly during rapid mode switching.
5. **Unit Tests for Edge Cases**: Create additional unit tests to cover edge cases related to clipping mode transitions, ensuring robustness.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
1. **Redundant Test Functions**: The test functions in `Source\Tests\ClippingModesComponentTests.cpp` and `Source\GUI\ClippingModesUIComponent.cpp` have overlapping functionality. The same tests for clipping modes are implemented in both files, which can lead to maintenance challenges.

2. **Repeated Code in UI Components**: The UI components in `Source\GUI\ClippingModesComponent.cpp` and `Source\GUI\ClippingModesUIComponent.cpp` share similar logic for handling user input and updating the UI. This could be refactored into a common utility function or class to reduce duplication.

3. **Similar Acceptance Criteria**: The acceptance criteria in `next_feature.txt` and the issues listed in `architect_notes.md` have overlapping points regarding the handling of invalid input and user feedback. This could be consolidated to streamline the documentation.

4. **Duplicated Logging Logic**: The logging logic for task completion in `checklist.md` and `checklist_progress.md` is repetitive. This could be centralized to a single logging function to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

## Bugs and Functional Issues
1. **Bug in Clipping Mode Switching**: The mode switching function does not properly handle invalid input types (e.g., strings or null values).
2. **Documentation Gap**: There is a lack of user documentation regarding the expected behavior of each clipping mode.
3. **UI Reset Issue**: The UI does not reset to a default state after an invalid selection, which may confuse users.

## Project Status Summary
### Completed Tasks
- Advanced Clipping Modes feature has been implemented and tested.
- All identified issues related to the Advanced Clipping Modes feature have been addressed.

### Project Gaps
- Need for comprehensive user documentation.
- Input validation enhancements required for mode switching.
- UI reset mechanism needs to be implemented.

### Unresolved Issues
- Potential memory leaks during rapid mode switching.
- Additional unit tests for edge cases related to clipping mode transitions are still needed.

## File and Directory Structure Adjustments
- Adjusted the project structure to align with the requirements in 'README.md':
  - Created directories for `Source/Core`, `Source/GUI`, `Source/Presets`, `Resources/Images`, `Resources/Presets`, `Tests/DSP`, `Tests/GUI`, `Tests/Integration`, and `Builds/Windows`, `Builds/MacOS`, `Builds/Linux`.
  - Ensured all files are placed in their respective directories as per the standard project structure.
