# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks
1. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
2. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
3. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.
4. Mark task as complete for the Advanced Clipping Modes feature.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
1. **Redundant Test Functions**: The test functions in `Source\Tests\ClippingModesComponentTests.cpp` and `Source\GUI\ClippingModesUIComponent.cpp` have overlapping functionality. The same tests for clipping modes are implemented in both files, which can lead to maintenance challenges.

2. **Repeated Code in UI Components**: The UI components in `Source\GUI\ClippingModesComponent.cpp` and `Source\GUI\ClippingModesUIComponent.cpp` share similar logic for handling user input and updating the UI. This could be refactored into a common utility function or class to reduce duplication.

3. **Similar Acceptance Criteria**: The acceptance criteria in `next_feature.txt` and the issues listed in `architect_notes.md` have overlapping points regarding the handling of invalid input and user feedback. This could be consolidated to streamline the documentation.

4. **Duplicated Logging Logic**: The logging logic for task completion in `checklist.md` and `checklist_progress.md` is repetitive. This could be centralized to a single logging function to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

## Bugs and Functional Issues
1. **Bug in Clipping Mode Switching**: The mode switching function does not properly handle invalid input types (e.g., strings or null values).
2. **Documentation Gap**: There is a lack of user documentation regarding the expected behavior of each clipping mode.
3. **UI Reset Issue**: The UI does not reset to a default state after an invalid selection, which may confuse users.
